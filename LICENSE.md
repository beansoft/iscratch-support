  ##### **Resolving Disputes**

  *Informal Resolution.* Before filing a legal claim against iScratch, you agree to try to resolve the dispute informally by contacting [beansoft@126.com](mailto:beansoft@126.com). If a dispute is not resolved within 15 days of submission, you may bring a formal claim.

  *Judicial Forum for Disputes.* Except to the extent applicable law provides otherwise, you and iScratch agree that any judicial proceeding to resolve claims relating to this Agreement or the Services will be brought in the federal or state courts of Beijing China, subject to the mandatory arbitration provisions below. Both you and iScratch consent to venue and personal jurisdiction in such courts.

  **PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING SECTIONS CAREFULLY! THEY MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT AND TO HAVE A JURY HEAR YOUR CLAIMS.**

  **U.S. RESIDENTS AGREE TO THE FOLLOWING MANDATORY ARBITRATION PROVISIONS:**

  *Agreement to Arbitrate.* You and iScratch agree to resolve any claims relating to the Agreement or the Services through final and binding arbitration by a single arbitrator, except as set forth below. This includes disputes arising out of or relating to interpretation or application of this section, including its enforceability, revocability, or validity.

  *Arbitration Procedures.* Arbitration is a less formal procedure than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, and court review of an arbitration award is very limited. The American Arbitration Association (“**AAA**”) will administer the arbitration under its Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes. AAA’s rules are available at [www.adr.org](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.adr.org&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1626126207232000&usg=AOvVaw2bRsRea34hzv5gZqFK2o55). The arbitration will be held in the United States county where you live or work, Ohio, or another mutually agreed-upon location.

  *Arbitration Costs.* The AAA rules will govern payment of all arbitration fees. iScratch will pay all arbitration fees for individual arbitration for claims less than $10,000 unless the arbitrator determines that the claim is frivolous. iScratch will not seek its attorneys' fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines that the claim is frivolous.

  *Opt-Out Procedure.* YOU CAN REJECT THIS AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE (“**OPT-OUT**”) BY EMAILING US AT beansoft@126.com WITHIN 30 DAYS OF FIRST REGISTERING YOUR ACCOUNT AND PROVIDING US WITH YOUR NAME, EMAIL ADDRESS, AND A CLEAR STATEMENT SHOWING YOUR INTENT TO OPT OUT OF THE ARBITRATION AGREEMENT. HOWEVER, IF YOU AGREED TO A PREVIOUS VERSION OF THESE TERMS THAT ALLOWED YOU TO OPT OUT OF ARBITRATION, YOUR PREVIOUS CHOICE TO OPT-OUT OR NOT OPT-OUT REMAINS BINDING.

  *Exceptions to Agreement to Arbitrate.* Either you or iScratch may assert claims, if they qualify, in small claims court in Ohio or any United States county where you live or work. Either party may bring a lawsuit solely for injunctive relief to stop unauthorized use or abuse of the Services, or intellectual property infringement (for example, trademark, trade secret, copyright, or patent rights) without first engaging in arbitration or the informal dispute-resolution process described above. If the agreement to arbitrate is found not to apply to you or your claim, you agree to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts in Ohio to resolve your claim.

  *No Class Actions*. YOU AND PIECES AGREE THAT EACH OF US MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS, OR REPRESENTATIVE OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION OR PROCEEDING. CLASS ARBITRATIONS, CLASS ACTIONS, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTIONS, AND CONSOLIDATION WITH OTHER ARBITRATIONS ARE NOT ALLOWED. IF THIS SPECIFIC PARAGRAPH IS HELD UNENFORCEABLE, THEN THE ENTIRETY OF THIS MANDATORY ARBITRATION SECTION WILL BE DEEMED VOID.

  ##### **Controlling Law**

  Except to the extent applicable law provides otherwise, these Terms will be governed by Chinese law without regard to conflict of law provisions.

  **Survival**

  All provisions of this Agreement which, by their nature, should survive termination will survive termination — including, without limitation: ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnification, dispute resolution, controlling law, and limitations of liability.

  ##### **Entire Agreement**

  This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between you and iScratch with respect to the subject matter, and supersedes and replaces any other prior or contemporaneous agreements, oral or written, or terms and conditions applicable to the subject matter of this Agreement. This Agreement may only be modified by a written amendment signed by an authorized representative of iScratch, or by the posting by iScratch of a revised version. This Agreement creates no third-party beneficiary rights.

  ##### **Waiver, Severability & Assignment**

  iScratch’s failure to enforce a provision is not a waiver of its right to do so later. If a provision is found unenforceable, the remaining provisions of the Agreement will remain in full effect and that portion of the Agreement will be construed to reflect the parties’ original intent. You may not assign any of your rights under this Agreement, and any such attempt will be void. iScratch may assign its rights to any of its affiliates or subsidiaries, or to any successor in interest of any business associated with the Services.

  ##### **Modifications**

  iScratch reserves the right, at our sole discretion, to amend these Terms at any time and we will update these Terms in the event of any such amendments. We will notify you of material changes to this Agreement via a notification in the Services or by sending email to the primary email address specified in your iScratch account. These updated terms will be effective no less than 30 days from when we notify you. If you do not agree to the updates, please cancel your iScratch account and stop using the Services before the updates become effective. Your continued use of the Services after those 30 days constitutes your agreement to those revisions of this Agreement. For any other modifications, your continued use of the Services constitutes agreement to our revisions of these Terms.

  ##### **DMCA Policy**

  Thank you for your attention to iScratch’s DMCA Policy. Capitalized terms used but not defined in this DMCA Policy have the meanings assigned to them in our Terms of Service. iScratch does not permit copyright infringing activities and infringement of intellectual property rights on its Services.

Upon receipt of Notice (as described below), iScratch will take whatever action, in its sole discretion, it deems appropriate, including removal of the allegedly infringing content from the Services.

  ##### **DMCA Notice of Alleged Infringement (“Notice”)**

  Identify the copyrighted work that you claim has been infringed. If multiple copyrighted works are covered by this Notice, you may provide a representative list of the copyrighted works that you claim have been infringed. iScratch can only accept DMCA takedown notices for works that are protected by copyright, and that identify a specific copyrightable work.

  Identify the material or link you claim is infringing (or the subject of infringing activity) and to which access is to be disabled, including at a minimum, if applicable, the URL of the link or the exact location where such material may be found.

  Provide your company affiliation (if applicable), mailing address, telephone number, and, if available, email address.

  Include both of the following statements in the body of the Notice:

  “I hereby state that I have a good faith belief that the disputed use of the copyrighted material is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law (e.g., as a fair use).”

  “I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.”
